        <h2 id="h2_startscreen">Count Olaf awakens one spring morning in his castle. As every day the first thing he does is looking for one of his glasses laying on the nightstand.  But oh no! Where are they? The count´s face turns pale, and he immediately calls his assistant Orlando for help. 
            Now it´s your turn. Collect all glasses you can find and bring them back to Count Olaf. But be careful and don´t get distracted by your boyfriend, the count´s gardener.
